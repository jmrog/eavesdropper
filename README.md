Eavesdropper.js
===============

Eavesdropper is a very basic jQuery plugin/wrapper that is useful for tracking
or otherwise identifying the event listeners that are set on a jQuery object.
It accomplishes its goals by gently wrapping `jQuery.fn.on` and `jQuery.fn.off`.

*NOTE:* This is in a very early stage of development and currently supports a
fairly minimal set of actions. Read the comments for details.
